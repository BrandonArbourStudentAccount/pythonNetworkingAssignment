# File Hashing Module

This repostitory contains hashing.py, a file hashing script that takes an input file and creates a hash value. This hash value can be output to standard out, a file called hashes.txt, or both. It also has an option to compare the hash of a file to the hash saved previously in hashes.txt.

## Usage

> python hashing.py -path <PATH>
> python hasning.py -path <PATH> -output <file/std-out/both>
> python hashing.py -path <PATH> -compare <True/False>
